Ok, just say me what DOES work.
Planetary shields are still functional, sir. But that's pretty much it. 
Can that give us enough time to recover?
Shields will not hold against concentrated attack for long. If we'd have guns working...
Well, THEIR guns ARE working.
You says it like it's a good thing.
I think I have an idea, Colonel...
*Control Sir Snake with mouse movement to deflect enemy projectiles. Do not let them hit the bottom of the screen.

I can't believe it worked, sir. Why do they keep shooting, even if they see they kill themselves?
Those are drones with a pretty simple programming. And whoever commands them is probably not much smarter, attacking Imperials outpost like this.
That gives us a chance. By the way, I can use the scrap from those drones to repair some of our facilities.
So, the more of them I break, the faster we'll be back online?
Basically. And try to not put too much strain on shields - I need energy for repairs too.
*Score is given for each destroyed enemy. You get more if shield level is high. Score unlocks upgrades.

So, will we have reinforcements anytime soon?
I have sent distress signal immediately, but no response yet. I suspect we are not only ones that have problems.

I'm starting to think it's not a random raid. They are after THAT.
But only three snakes know that THAT is here, sir.
Four. And someone also could make a lucky guess.

I have caught some broadcasts, sir. Something bad on global scale is happening. Circarians attack everywhere. And Empress is nowhere to be seen.
That confirms our suspicions. Try to find out more.

There is no end of them, sir. It's miracle we are still holding.
What else can we do?
Well... With some time and spare parts I can maybe hack up an escape ship.
Do it. Looks like the best chance so far. For us and... THAT.
*Collect enough resources (i.e. score) for escape ship

Good news, sir. I have got a message that help is coming.
And bad news?
It's Prince Snake's fleet.
Awfully convinient, isn't it. Speed up on that ship.
