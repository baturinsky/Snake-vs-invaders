export let talkAll = `Ok, just say me what DOES work.
Planetary shields are still functional, sir.| But that's pretty much it. 
Can that give us enough time to recover?
Shields will not hold against concentrated attack for long.| If we'd have guns working...
Well, THEIR guns ARE working.
You say it like it's a good thing.
I think I have an idea, Colonel...
*Control Sir Snake with mouse movement to deflect bullets BACK at enemies.| Do not let bullets hit the Planetary Shield at the bottom of the screen.

I can't believe it worked, sir.| Why do they keep shooting, even if they see they kill themselves?
Those are drones with a pretty simple programming, Colonel.| And whoever commands them is probably not much smarter,| attacking Imperial outpost like this.
That gives us a chance.
*Right click toggles Active Pause mode.| In that mode, time stops when you don't move.|It can be used to read these message in peace too.

So, will we have reinforcements anytime soon?
I have sent distress signal immediately, but no response yet.| I suspect we are not only ones that have problems.
Too bad. I manage so far, but I can't be everywhere at once.
*To limit Sir Snake objective speed, time speeds up if you move mouse too fast.

By the way, sir, I can use the scrap from those drones to repair some of our facilities.
So, the more of them I break, the faster we'll be back online?
Basically. And try not to put too much strain on shields.| I need energy for repairs too.
*Score is given for each destroyed enemy.| You get more if shield level is high. Score unlocks upgrades.

I'm starting to think it's not a random raid.| They are after THAT.
But only three snakes know THAT is here, sir.
Four. And someone also could make a lucky guess.
*You can destroy enemies by ramming them at the cost of temporarily losing a part of your tail.

Next wave incoming, sir. Are you ready?
I was born ready.
Oh, right.| By the way, it seems that Circarians use our shields emission to navigate in the smoke.
Can we do something about that?
Not at the time frame we have.| On the plus side, emission drops with shield's level,| making it harder for them to find us.
*Enemy attacks intensity drops when Shield is low.

There is no end of them, sir.| It's miracle we are still holding.
What else can we do?
Well...| With some time and spare parts I can maybe hack up an escape ship.
Looks like the best chance so far.| For us and... THAT| Make sure it's shielded well enough to break through blocade.
*Collect enough resources (i.e. score) for the escape ship.| You can replay previous stages for that if necessary.| But only max score per stage counts.

I have caught some broadcasts, sir.| Something bad on global scale is happening.| Circarians attack everywhere. And Empress is nowhere to be seen.
That confirms my worst suspicions. Try to find out more.
*ESC takes you back to menu.

Sir...| Good news is, I have got a message that help is coming.
And bad news?
It's Prince Snake's fleet.
Awfully convenient, isn't it.| Speed up on that ship.

We did it, Colonel.
[Happy Snake Noises]
*Escape Ship is on the way from the doomed planet.
*Bringing our heroes and the mysterious McGuffin to the Episode 3 of the Flight of the Snake saga.
*I had no bytes left for any music,|but imagine anything from Space Rangers 2 OST playing now.
*If it's not obvious enough, you have won the game.
*This level is just an interactive ending cinematic, basically.
*But you still get points for it! Heh heh...
*If you wonder, no, there is no Episode 1.
*Yet.
*Thanks for playing! And please, leave feedback.
